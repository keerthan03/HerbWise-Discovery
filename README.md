# HerbWise

A mobile application developed with Android Studio for detecting medicinal plants using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) models.

## Overview

This Android application utilizes machine learning models to identify various medicinal plants from images captured by the device's camera. With a compact and efficient model, it offers accurate detection for over 40 classes of medicinal plants. The app is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to both horticulturists and the general public, aiming to promote awareness and understanding of medicinal plants and their benefits.

## Features

- **Medicinal Plant Detection**: Real-time detection of medicinal plants from images.
- **Compact Model**: Utilizes a minimal and efficient TensorFlow Lite model for fast inference on mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI/UX design for easy navigation and interaction.
- **Educational Tool**: Provides information about detected plants and their medicinal properties, serving as a learning resource.
- **Offline Support**: Works without an internet connection, ensuring accessibility in remote areas.
